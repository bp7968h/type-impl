# type-impl

**type-impl** is a Rust project aimed at learning and understanding the fundamentals of data structures by implementing common types from scratch. This includes types like `Vector`, `HashMap`, and others commonly found in standard libraries.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Deepen understanding of Rust's core concepts, such as ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
- Explore low-level details of data structure implementations.
- Gain hands-on experience with algorithms and memory management.

## Features

- Implement foundational types like:
  - 
- Write tests to ensure correctness and robustness.
